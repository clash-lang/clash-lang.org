Clash is actively maintained by [QBayLogic](https://qbaylogic.com/).
You can [contract QBayLogic](mailto:info@qbaylogic.com) to provide expert help and support in situations where:

* You need direct-line (e.g. phone) support for the Clash compiler
* You need an active developer that needs to fix a bug that shows up in code that can only be shared under NDA.
* You require a new feature to be added to the CλaSH compiler, or require a custom version of the CλaSH compiler. The latter can occur when there is no community consensus about a particular (disruptive) change.
* You quickly need to knows things like: "What is the best way to do this in Clash?", or "How do I generalize this Clash code?"
* ... and anything else that helps. [Just reach out](mailto:info@qbaylogic.com).
